                           <h3>Domain and Context</h3>
                           <p>E-commerce and digital consumer experience have dramatically changed the beauty industry, giving consumers the ability to purchase cosmetics directly online. The very personal nature of these products, however, adds an element of risk to such purchases; customers have no way of knowing how a particular cosmetic or beauty item will look on their own faces, or the quality of such products. This feeling of risk increases the more the consumer deviates from their accustomed “look” and cause frustration and unhappiness for the consumers. In addition to that, although people often visit YouTube to find video makeup tutorials, they still have no idea how the makeup would look on their own faces until after they finish applying the makeup. </p>
                           
                           <h3>Constraints</h3>
                           <p>When shopping for cosmetic products, people either have to try them on in the shop or, if shopping online, accept the risk that the product they buy will not look good on them. When following YouTube tutorials, people may find the “look” they want, but the risk of not knowing how it will look on their faces still exists.</p>

                            <img src="images/ar/competitive.jpg" class="nk-img-fit" alt="Competitive Analysis"><br />
                            <p>Although “Try it on” features are part of some mobile apps, space constraints make a mobile screen less than ideal for trying on a multifaceted new look. Many cosmetic try-on apps require the user to upload a photo of themselves, limiting them to a single static version of their potential look.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Prototype</h3>
                        <p>We built this physical prototype by using markers, paper, and wizard of oz to demonstrate the key interactions of our solution: selecting an occasion and trying different looks.</p>

                        <div class="nk-gap-2"></div>

                        <h3>Digital Prototype</h3>
                        <p>While our team worked on the physical prototype collaboratively, we built our own digital prototypes invididully focusing on the same interaction - switching between looks, but with different tools.</p>
                        <h4>Version 1</h4>
                        <p>I decided to use Origami Studio because I found its feature of adding an object of a webcam livestream in a prototype during my research of tools. The prototype is mainly made of 4 objects: the webcam livestream, the selection bar that allows users to select looks, the look overlay, and the selector that indicates the look currently being selected. </p>

                        <div class="nk-gap-2"></div>
                        <h4>Improvements</h4>
                        <p>Since Origami doesn’t provide features related to face detection, the main feedback that I got is whether it would be possible to combine the prototypes that my teammates created with Lens Studio or Spark AR with mine given the fact that they were able to create realistic looks that I was unable to do with Origami while at the same time they couldn’t provide the switching looks feature with those tools.</p>
                        <div class="nk-gap-2"></div>
                        <h4>Version 2</h4>
                        <p>I then went to Lens Studio and created my own looks by using Photoshop with the example provided. I then decided to record videos of the looks that I created in Lens Studio, and built this new prototype by toggling the videos when selecting looks in Origami. Nonetheless, it doesn’t seem to provide transitions that I used for the previous prototype for videos, so the interaction doesn’t look as smooth as the first version although I have the looks in much higher fidelity in this new version.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2><br />
                        <p>I learned 2 new prototyping tools - Origami Studio and Lens Studio when working on this project and they are actually not as difficult as I imagined. It seems like currently there’s no perfect tool that can be used to build the prototype exactly the way we want it to be but I learned the strengths and downsides of the tools. For Origami, it provides the feature of adding a live stream video, which is something very few other prototyping tools provide and can be used for not only AR but also many camera projects. With Lens Studio, I can create looks and face paint with very high-fidelity while it doesn’t provide features to build interactions. In the end, I believe the decision of which tool to use will go back to the question that what it is we want to test and verify. I was limited to the idea of using only 1 tool while I realized that there are also more possibilities if I can use a couple of different tools that make up for one another.</p><br />
